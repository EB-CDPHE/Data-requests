## Background 
Alicia Cronquist appointed Eduardo and I to take the place of Breanna Kawasaki and Millen Tsegaye in managing the COVID19 section of the 2022 Statewide Lab Survey. The email is [here](./documents/Email_022222.pdf). This annual web survey of clinical labs has been managed by Colleen McGuinness and Erin Yonkin. Here is link to the project management sheet:

## Questionnaire
The link to the 2021 Statewide Lab Survey is [here](Documents/2021%20Statewide%20Lab%20Survey.pdf).

## Question Map
I created a "question map" to document revised wording and structure of survey questions. This map lists "items" for introductory filter questions, off-site testing, on-site test type, PCR testing platform, and reporting of results.

## Flow diagram
Based on the question map, I developed a flow diagram to lay out the branch logic to be used for the survey items. This was created in Diagram.NET. 
1. Diamonds are branching questions 
2. "Skips" come out bottom of diamonds, follow-up questions take the high road.
3. Solid arrow is direct progression of questions. Arrows out of diamonds show branching logic.
4. Dash arrow shows branch logic for question items that are not contiguous in survey flow
5. Items are generally marked sequentially. Decimal is used to denote follow-up to parent question. Letter suffix is used to denote question part to a common stem.
