## Background 
On October 5, 2021 Rachel Herlihy received an [email](./Documents/Email_request.pdf) requesting aggregated data to be included in CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). On October 12, 2021 Eduardo asked me to respond to this data request. The CDC email contained an [Excel spreadsheet template](./Documents/Worksheet_2020_Aggregate_COVID-19_Data.xlsx) with instructions. 

**Population**:  Confirmed and probable cases reported to CEDRS for Colorado residents during the 12 "MMWR" months of 2020.  **Groups**: Case status (confirmed and probable) by MMWR Month, Age Group, Sex, and Race and Ethnicity combined.  **Data requested**: Aggregated case counts for confirmed and probable cases. 

## Response
Final response was delivered snippet of SAS output placed in chat to Eduardo.

## Code
In preparation for aggregating the data, I checked the data, particularly the group variables, using [Check.Aggregate_Counts_NNDSS.sas](SAS/Check.Aggregate_Counts_NNDSS.sas). The SAS program [RFI.Aggregate_Counts_NNDSS.sas](SAS/RFI.Aggregate_Counts_NNDSS.sas) was used complete the tables in the Excel spreadsheet template.
