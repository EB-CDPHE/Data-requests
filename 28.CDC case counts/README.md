## Background 
CDC scrapes the CDPHE website daily to capture Colorado case counts. It calculates the differences each day to determine new cases. However, CDPHE dashboard for COVID-19 reflects not only the diseaes dynamics in the Colorado population but also workload constraints and integration issues. Thus, when the CDPHE dashboard is updated with a large bolus of cases, it appears to CDC as a spike in case counts. So, for example, recently Colorado has been erronously identified as a national hotspot. To amend this situation, we have been asked to report historical case counts to CDC weekly.

Some of the background regarding this request is part of a lengthy email [chain](../28/../28.CDC%20case%20counts/Documents/CDC_Historical_Case_Count_RFI_032122.pdf) between CDPHE and the CDC Aggregate Data team. The original request came in March 14, 2022. I was tasked with it on March 21, 2022.  The email contains the specific data elements requested. 

**Population**:  Confirmed and probable cases in CEDRS by ReportedDate. Include cases unallocated to a county, i.e. `CountyAssigned="INTERNATIONAL"` **Groups**: Case status (confirmed and probable) and Outcome (Patient died) for all of Colorado and by Colorado county.  **Data requested**: Daily count of confirmed, probable, and total cases. Daily count of deaths for confirmed and probable cases, and total deaths. For each of these outcomes a cumulative daily total was calcualted. Daily change in cumulative totals was calcuated for total cases and total deaths. 

## Code
Here are the SAS programs used to respond to this data request:

|Run order|SAS program|
|---------|-----------|
|1.|[Access.CEDRS_view](../0.Universal/SAS%20code/Access.CEDRS_view.sas) pulls data from dbo144 COVID19 and curates it.|
|2.|[FIX.CEDRS_view](../0.Universal/SAS%20code/Fix.CEDRS_view.sas) edits data pulled from CEDRS.|
|3.|[RFI.Pediatric_cases.sas](./SAS/RFI.Pediatric_cases.sas) filters CEDRS data to population defined above.|

## Findings
At the time of this response, here are the calculated totals for the requested data:

![VarTotals](./Var_totals.png)

The N=631 is the number of days between January 1, 2020 and September 22, 2021.

## Response
Final output from SAS was saved as a CSV file:  [Colorado Historical Data](Colorado_Historical_data.csv) CDC provided a template for recieving historical data. I re-ordered the columns in the CSV file to match their template and then copied the column headers. I saved the modifed csv file as and Excel file named [Bulk Historical Update Colorado](Bulk_Historical_Update_Colorado.xlsx). This was emailed to Sarah of the Aggregate Data team at CDC on September 24, 2021.

## Code
#### The SAS program used to generate the response was [RFI.Historical_case_counts.sas](RFI.Historical_case_counts.sas). 
To update this response, the following would need to be done:
1. Modify the section of SAS code that creates a timeline, i.e. continuous unbroken list of ReportedDate's from January 1, 2020 to present. Specifically, increase the number of iterations that the DO loop runs.

2. Follow steps to create an updated version of COVID.CEDRS_view_fix dataset to pull the latest data on reported COVID cases in Colorado.

The final dataset was exported to create the CSV file for the responding to this data request. The code generated by the export wizard was [Export.COHxData.sas](Export.COHxData.sas)
